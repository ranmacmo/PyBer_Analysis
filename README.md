## Project Overview 
Analysis of ride sharing data across different city types to determine any seasonal or fare differences. 

## Analysis Process 

###  Data Resources 
- Data Source: Resources/city_data.csv 
- Data Source: Resources/ride_data.csv 

 ### Process 
 1. Create ride sharing summary data by city type 
		- Total Rides   
		- Total Drivers   
		- Total Fares   
		- Average Fare per Ride   
		- Average Fare per Driver   
2. Chart total fares for each city type from 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29
